YouTube HTML5 Switch
================================

[![logo][https://raw.github.com/constanton/youtube_html5_switch/master/data/html5switch100.jpeg ]]

This is a very simple Firefox Add-on that adds the "html5=1" parameter inside the address bar of the tab that is currently active. Only with a simple click on the widget.


## Improvements to be made

Obviously many but for starters let's...
* Create a logo and an icon for the widget
* Automatically change the URL without a widget.

The Add-on is under the MIT Licence as described on LICENCE.txt
